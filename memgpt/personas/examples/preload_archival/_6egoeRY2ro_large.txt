 Okay, good afternoon. Those who are just joining us, you early birds, we're going to be silent for 30 seconds to a minute or so, I think we can get started. For those who don't know me, I'm Damian. I'm one of the co-chairs for the year. I can't believe this is the last session of what has been a great day. It's the second Ignite session that I'm holding. First was absolutely brilliant, so no pressure, gentlemen. Thanks to everybody who has joined. We will start off with Holger. Ben, this is an interesting one. We're going to do a bit of tag teaming. So the gentlemen have self-organized, realized there are commonalities between their talks and they're going to basically tag team each other as they go through. We've decided that it makes sense that we do a one big question and answer session at the end, once we've been through all the talks. However, really keen for conversation, feel free to post questions in the chat, questions you've brought with to the session with you, questions that come along just as we go. What I'll try and do is make sure that those get answered and I'll try and find any commonalities or themes that are worth us discussing at the end. But Holger, why don't you introduce yourself and tell us about selecting low and no code applications? Although I'd love for you to tell me the difference between low and no code applications. Although I'd love to tell you, for you to tell me the difference between low and no, in this context. But yes, using orderly mapping to determine a low no code platform. Holger. Yeah, I'm Holger, I'm 56 years old and I'm looking about business because I founded some companies 25 years ago, and I'm always working on the field of strategy and technology and culture. I'll bring people working better together. And the last six years, I'm a mapping fan. I do all my projects in mapping and to give better overview of projects, of business initiative and strategy consulting. I make a lot of strategy consulting with Wardley Maps and why I'm here and I love Wardley Mapping and have a project I want to talk about what I bring with. But Damian, I didn't understand, should we introduce now all or every speaker go ahead, straight ahead? No, no, you dive into your content and then otherwise we'll have this detached bit where it's that, is that the guy who said he was talking about NBA or this other guy? So you go ahead, straight into your content. When I start with my presentation. Okay. I start with my presentation? And OK, so you see me, you hear me, you need to see my presentation. OK, how can we use water mapping for selecting a low-code, no-code environment? And this is my presentation. And I have today three major maps we made in this project. We have a lot of deeper maps, but I want to show you three major maps. And my agenda today, I show you have a team, not everybody has the same arguments for value, because you have a clear understanding of what is value for us. And then only one slide, what is low-code, no-code. And then we have, when we are in buying dilemmas, because why, this is what also Benjamin is later talking about, pioneer, settler planners, what polarities and dilemmas we are when selecting a platform. And this is my presentation and what we start with, that is very important for us when we look at this picture here to understand the landscape. I'm working in this project as an external project leader. It was a company, big company, they have got 4,000 students a day. It was not a university, it's a private company who has unemployment people in Germany and then they teach new courses and new education. And when we look about our project, we have to understand the landscape and we're using, we're looking for a vendor, they understand our landscape and then we have the vendor and what is value for us. And the first map, it's not the real map because we have deeper maps inside, but it's only a skeleton about that when we talk about pipelines. Because when we look at our business, when you bring up what we met in the company, you have a new language. And the new language, what can you do to bring to the right? What can you bring to the right? And that means that we have five pipelines we are talking about. And it was very important that we understand that they have a sales pipeline. When they have the students, they have new idea, and they have a very quick, with a sales close cycle and sales or cycle length, when they get in contract. But sales, sales need the course. And when we develop new course, we have to very fast develop courses, because we earn more money here in this space and then when we earn less money, anybody has the same course. When we choose these five pipelines because course delivery, participant learning and the participants need to have an exam. In Germany you have to make exams in the ERK. And what the mapping was very useful to talk about, what is our business model, what is our pipelines? It was the first clear understanding that we have on one page our landscape and with the pipelines. And then we make a map, what is value for us? What is value for us? What is value for us when we look about a vendor? And when we make a business case, when we when we are looking for measurable, what what is the business half year? And then it was also a big need for us that we have a partner which understands our landscape and gives us tips what we can do. And this means also that you get trust with the partner, vendor. A partner can bring us in small steps. That means the partner needs a clear consulting model, we understand. A framework, how can we get to a solution? Which was our second map, focus on the value. And one slide to low-code, no-code. And the low-code, no-code environment are software platforms like ClickView, Monday.com, but as normal ones, or the big ones, Mandix, or OutSystems, which a normal user can make software or workflows. You don't need help of the IT department. This is because no-code and no-code platform are so rising at the moment. But what's very important for us when we look at the Waldauwende, they have to understand what is value, what are our bio-dilemmas, because when we are here we have paradoxes to balance. We have paradoxes to balance which means in which tensions and which conflicts we are, because we need the pioneer view, the pioneer view, how can we get better, how can we are, because we need the pioneer view. The pioneer view, how can we get better? How can we compete? How we can get the market? But on the other side, we have a town planner view. We don't want to make risks in the migration of a low-code platform. And then we have a big tension. And in the software vendor understands this tension where we win because they help us in our polarities to discuss. And another thing, what we like to do, it's the software vendors or consulting partner, make their homework. They have to speak in our language. Because I put here some very good Gartner frameworks. Otherwise, it's the Gartner KPI framework. And the other one is the Gartner risk model frameworks. This means a partner has to speak in our language. Because when you talk to a sales guy, you can say, OK, how can we help you to maximize the sales close rate? Which is a very valuable business language. And this means also when we talk to a vendor, did they understand our business language and they would understand our business environment. And I love this book. I love this book and it's a challenge of sale. It's a brilliant book. But this slide is very important because the greatest drivers of loyalty means a partner who helps us to understand potential landmines, a partner who helps us to understand what are difficult ways. And when we look at our project, we have a big problem because we have a lot of custom built software in the 10 years old, 15 years old. And now we want to jump to the cloud. And the problem at the moment is all the stuff here didn't have any experience in cloud and no code, low code. When you don't understand this platform, you are not able to bring new ideas on the table. You don't know what is possible. And then we need a partner. We trust them. And we are going on the way to, like Agile, like Agile development to understand what is possible and look at our polarities. And this is why we need a partner with a clear consulting model. Because it's a clear consulting model. This is the last map. The clear consulting model, when we look about the selecting of software vendors, we have new chances here. How can you compete? How can you make better business? But otherwise, we have a big, big need about risk avoiding. And risk avoiding means for us, when we select the vendor or select the company, we want the silent migration, because we don't want, oh, nothing is working anymore. And we need a strong partner network, and we need a partner that has a clear consulting framework, because it gives us a chance for lower risks. So and this was the final map here. And when we see different partners and vendors, every about the team has this map. And they charge, they make the map of the partner. How do you see this partner? What is the feeling about this partner? And this, we use these three maps to look at the partner and map it out. How do you see the partner? Did they have a clear consulting framework, good or bad? So in this case, I don't know. I think now I have 10 minutes, Damian. We need these maps for selecting software vendors and partners. This was my approach in 10 minutes. I know we can talk for three hours about this topic. I was really not going to stop you because you're almost perfectly on, but not a problem at all. Really interesting, and I think I might just hit you up directly on evaluating this market, because it's something that I see so much power and potential in. We will, oh, we'll dive straight into Benjamin. Thank you so much Damien. Holger, great job. Thank you for queuing up some pioneer settler town planner discussion. My name is Ben. I work at probably the largest auto maker in the world. I can't mention any names, but they serve sushi in the cafeteria. And I help stand up new technology and innovation teams and develop process tools and team habits to help them succeed. I'm going to talk today about a metaphor. Let me share this. All right. We're going to talk about the metaphor of the pioneer, the settlers, and the town planners. This may, I don't know, maybe this is the only presentation at Map Camp without a map. We're just going to look at the canvas and look at the pioneer, settlers, and town planners and how we can think about them. So let's explore the PST metaphor in the context of problem solving. Not this kind of problem solving. Unless that's your thing, but a different kind of problem solving the PST metaphor uses personas to mark a place on the map. Those personas are the pioneers, the settlers, the town planners. Different personas have different approaches to problem solving. That is, a pioneer prefers to solve problems differently than a town planner does. But let's not think of these personas as typologies, okay? Let's think of them as markers on a continuum of a preference for structure. Let me bring in some problem-solving environments that we may be familiar with. This is from the framework Cuneven. And some of you may be familiar with these problem solving environments. But I think these line up pretty well as we have them on the screen. On the left-hand side of your map, you have the complex problem solving environment. And in the complex environments, we don't know where the boundaries are. And this is fine for the pioneers because they don't have a preference for structure anyway. They're fine with some failure, they're skilled and probing and sensing and finding out where those boundaries are and this is the space where our agile methodologies are really successful. So at the other end of the spectrum in the clear problem solving environment, we have very clear well-defined boundaries. This is good for town planners because they really prefer well-defined problems. In fact, their problem solving style is they want to accurately categorize the problem so they can apply the appropriate standard of policy. This is the realm of best practices. In the middle is our complicated problem-solving environment. There is some structure here. There is a linear cause and effect in this space, and that's great for our settlers. They don't have a strong preference for more or less structure, and they can use their expertise to analyze the system, identify the countermeasure for the problem, and then implement it. This is where Kaizen and Lean and continuous improvement are really effective. So everyone within the sound of my voice has a preference for more or less structure in their problem solving. You have a preference for the problems you like to work on. You have a preference for where on the map you prefer to do your work. Now, we know this because of some pioneering work, pun intended, by a brilliant British psychologist named Dr. Michael Curtin. Some 40 years ago, Curtin developed the Curtin Adaption Innovation Theory. Simply it states, we are all creative. We all solve problems, but we have different styles for doing so. The difference in our styles depends upon how much structure we prefer in our problem-solving. Dr. Curtin also pointed out that problem-solving preferences are normally distributed. So, right now you may be asking, why is this even a big deal? We can accept the fact that we all have a problem solving style. It's based on how much structure we want in our problem solving environment. Because it's normally distributed, we know that the world wants a lot of people, without very strong preferences, the settlers. And the world wants a few people who prefer less structure, the pioneers, and a few people that prefer a lot of structure, the town planners. I'll tell you why this is important. Successful companies manage this diversity in cognitive style successfully, effectively. Let's use Apple as an example. Steve Jobs, obviously a pioneer. He thought in analogies and metaphors and was a visionary. However, his visions would never have been a commercial success unless he had the support of someone on the other end of the problem solving spectrum that thought in terms of systems and process. Someone who could dig into the details and build a platform that could support Jobs' vision. But Cook's systems could make money with. He did so with the amazing products that he designed. While we're here, let's explore the superpowers of the different problem-solving styles. The folks who prefer less structure, they tend to think in metaphors and analogies. They tend to not be as interested in detail. They're interested in the big picture. They tend to redefine the problem. That's part of problem solving for them. They will often challenge the rules. They will pursue solutions even if they have to break the rules. And they can appear insensitive and abrasive sometimes. However, that's actually an efficiency function that we won't have time to go into right now. Their kryptonite is that they would discard the current system too quickly. And if they had a motto, it would be doing things differently. At the other end of our problem solving spectrum we have the town, they will approach problems in the safe reliable methodical way. They strive for efficiency and mastering the details. They prefer well defined problem. They will rarely challenge the rules in fact they want to solve the problem by using the current rules. high value on group consensus and group decision making. Their kryptonite is they will hold on to the current system too long. A corporate example might be Kodak. If these folks had a motto, it would be doing things better. Finally, our settlers who don't have a strong preference for structure, their superpower is their flexibility. They can bridge these extreme styles. They can be very good facilitators if they're willing and if they've been trained. They bring a balanced consideration to problem solving their kryptonite is they can overlook value at the extremes. For example, they may round off the corners on a breakthrough innovation that's depriving a customer of a critical functionality, or they might overlook a detail in the current system that might come back to bite them later. Our settlers, if they had a motto, might be moving things forward. So I would like to share a little more of how we can use this knowledge about problem-solving style and great timing, I just happened to read a really, really great book that helped me understand some things that might be beneficial to you. The book, Team Topologies, excellent book. Matthew and Manuel talk about two important points that I would like to emphasize as well in the context of our pioneer settler and town planner metaphor. The two things that the authors emphasize the first one is Conway's law, and that is the structure of your teams, the communication pathways determine your solutions architecture. And that's super important to understand. And what I would add to this is you need to understand your team structure, including the cognitive styles, the problem-solving styles on your team. And I'm going to quickly give you a ridiculous example. If you have a room full of pioneers and you're looking for breakthrough ideas, you will get breakthrough ideas. You will get ideas you've never seen before, a long list of them. But because it's a room full of pioneers, those ideas may never turn into a product. This is the nature of those on this extreme of the problem solving spectrum. They like new ideas, but they sometimes get bogged down in the details that are required for development. So you need to balance your teams, you need some pioneers, you need some settlers, and you definitely need some town planners to help make this real. So, when you're considering your team structure, don't forget about the problem solving style, more details on that in just a minute. The second thing that team topologies authors point out is that we must minimize the cognitive load on our individuals and our teams. And in the book, they talk about making sure that you don't overload a team, have a streamlined team work on one feature, not three features. Because as you, if you have them work on multiple features, you dramatically increase the numbers of communications, communication pathways, tracking and reporting, it can be overwhelming. It sends up their cognitive load and decreases performance. What I would add to this is that cognitive load is also tied to your problem solving style. You want to try to match your teams or your individuals problem solving styles to the task. So if you ask a pioneer to create a registry of microservices, that's might not be a good match. Pioneers aren't really into the details. Now you may have to provide those some extra support, some processes, tools to help them do a good job, or you could ask a town planner to do that registry for microservices. Dr. Curtin had an important point for leaders. Good leaders ask for the minimum coping most of the time. If they do that, they get loyal teams who will give maximum coping in a time of crisis. Super important for our leaders to pay attention to what are your team members' problem-solving styles, and if you're creating or trying to support an autonomous team, the problem-solving styles assessments can help you do this. It will help you move to that place where you have more of that task self-selection. It will help you move to that place where you have more of that task self-selection. I know that was a lot. Dr. Curtin, after 15 years of research, came up with an inventory. There are 33 items that takes about 15 minutes to complete online. It measures your style, not your level, not your talent, not your IQ. Unfortunately, it's not self-scoring, but if you search up Curtin Adaption Innovation, you'll find folks that can connect you to how to use this inventory in your team. Finally, I would love to hear your thoughts on Twitter about the PST, Pioneer Settler Town Planner metaphor. Please drop my handle in there. Please hashtag weird mapping. I will send each of you a summary and these slides if you wish. I will also select at random 10 people to receive a KAI assessment. Thank you so much for your time and your attention. Back to you, Damien. Benjamin, that was a slam dunk. Thank you for your great layout. Now look, we're just going to rush through this. I really want to hear this guy speak. This is the last Ignite talk of today. Benjamin, I'll encourage you to watch the three earlier. You'll find one around mapping yourself that I think there's some real cross pollination there in terms of ideas. And I'll be taking a lot myself from that. Yeah, it's been a really great day. We've had lots of people for the last year jumping through hoops to get Mapcamp started and done. I cannot believe we're in the last talk. So I'm going to ask Joaquin, can you take us through to the buzzer? Hi, I hope that you can hear me. We can hear you loud and clear. Okay, thank you. So, well, my name is Joaquin. Right now I live in Sevilla, that is in the south of Spain. It's very hot still here. So, I work in DxE technology right now as a program manager and I have been doing so many stuff around IT delivery, business delivery, etc. I like basketball a lot. I discovered in 2013 barley maps and since then I have been trying to use them in so many contexts. One year ago I found that as maps you are not pointing the person, but pointing the map and trying to challenge the map. The point is that sometimes it's better to use a different context. And as I like a lot the basketball, I found that some examples are really nice when you put in a different context and then you try to remove the frame, the commercial market frame that we have and you put in a completely different place. So, basketball has so many rules, it has so many ways that you can play and at the end of the day, what I found is that the NBA, it's a close league with 30 franchises and what we can see in the, depending on the age that you have, you probably remember some of these picks in the 80s, Larry Bird and Maggie Johnson, in the 90s Michael Jordan, in the beginning of 2000 Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, or LeBron James and the Golden State Warriors. So the league, it's composed by a backstage and a stage. And the average NBA fan or NBA supporter, it's consuming content, attending the games in the stadium, watching on TV, and right now following up the social media. So there is a lot of concentration of short highlights, alley hoops, dance, that they are really, really well content, and this is one of the things that it's making the league to explode globally. But I don't want to talk about dance players, I want to talk on the backstage. Because there are organizations behind them. NBA was born 30 something years ago. And it was not easy but they have built a lot of rules to enable them to survive. So it's important from the franchise point of view that the 30 franchises, they have covered aes' organisation, they have money, they have a team, they have a franchise culture and they have a franchise organisation. And these are the basis for them to enable them to compete. Then they have the players. So in the stage, everybody sees the players, but on the backstage, we can see so many things. Evolution happens about different waves of diffusion, and I switch a little bit the horizontal axis, setting the supporter perception with different stages, tanking when the team is trying to remove expensive players and they want to have a good pickup in the draft, building a team that is building by themselves, a playoff team that is able to the supporter perception, but we both need to take that into account. As I said before, NVA has some internal rules, and they are really interesting because they try to enable that the 30 franchises are able to compete. So you can spend all the money that you want but then what you will have is that in terms of finance you have a salary cap. The salary cap is determined by the money that you are able to generate by yourself and if you want to spend more you have to pay a luxury tax to the league. So that luxury tax comes back to the league. There are different ways to play, it depends if you are a big city or a small city. There are so many things in terms of the calendar that it's very important to take into account. The league is always looking for the international expansion. There are trade rules, you cannot trade the players anytime. There are rules for Portugal, the league can even reject some type of trading etc. etc. etc. There are free agencies so the players have the right to pick where they want to go and there are so many things related because the players have so many things to do. And here it comes to the fact that there are so many overloops in the league that I will review, because things don the Golden State Warriors. So the story started in 2010 when Joe Lackhoff and Peter Graber acquired the franchise. And they acquired all this money. And how they started, it was building the franchise from the start. So they are two people that they come from Silicon Valley, and they completely wanted to do something different because they saw a lot of value and a lot of issues in the way that the team was managed before. So one of the things that they started doing, it was to change the culture, what we call doctrines. They completely radical in guiding principles and the way to do it. And they summarize as in strength in numbers. So they were pioneers looking for the players fit. They were pioneers looking for the players' fit. It's not the same, the individual contribution, that the total contribution of three players combined. That players' fit, it's something that they evaluate with advanced statistics and they do a lot of analysis and work on that. statistics and they do a lot of analysis and work on that. They got a new general manager, Paul Myers, they had already a very small guy called Steph Curry, and they got in the picks Clay Thompson, Damon Green, that they were not high picks in the NBA draft. But they were starting to build all that thing quickly. Four years after, in 2014, what happened, it was that they received the Sport Business Awards. That it's a business award where they compete with the football, the NFL, and the baseball, and the hockey. So, they won, and they say, well, this management team is doing a great job in just four years. They completely changed the way to execute. And they have a clear long-term plan and organizational structure that other teams started to copy. They were selling so many tickets and they are in San Francisco and they were able to hire and to increase the prices because there are so many people with a lot of money from the tech industry. And they were willing to pay all that money. So, they were having their plan and they were implementing the plan. They didn't want anything. The players were evolving, but that's it. What happened, it was that in the next five years between 2015 and 2019, they were reaching and they were contenders. Contenders, to me, it's a team that is able to reach at least the conference final. They reached the finals, the NBA finals for the five years and they won three of them. There were so many things. They won the first one, then they lose the second one against the Cavaliers, then they won two, and then they missed the last one against the Toronto Raptors. And what happened was that basically in the final, they lose two of the major principal players, Kevin Durant and Clay Thompson. And then, well, that's it. So what happened at the end of the league, it was, okay, the fan base was like, oh shit, now we're tanking for several years. And then the owners were like, no, no, no, no way. We have a plan. We have a long-term plan. We are not going to get rid of all the things we built. So they basically have clear that everything was working well. We need just a few changes. And they did. And the COVID season, they were really doing really bad. I mean, they have a Clay Thompson out, Kevin Durant left the team, Andre Iguodala left the team. There were some incorporations that they didn't work, not good fit. They added someone named Jordan Poole. A fiasco, completely fiasco, but they keep it. Then the second session, same thing. They added one good guy. They have a steel Clay Thompson on the bench. But this year, they were able to do really, really well. And when I was doing this, this was in February, they were really doing good numbers and they recovered all the activities. So, what happened at the end, it was that as contenders, they finally won the NBA. The point is that the owners have a long-term view and the value of the franchise right now is considered to be the second most important thing, the second most important one that it's 5.6 billion dollars in US dollars. So that's it., there are so many things we can learn from this environment and when we want to look for a different context, this could be a good one to try to de-stress the challenging questions that we want to put on the table. So, that's it. Thank you Damian. Joaquin, thank you so much and apologies for the basketball related puns. So what did we go through there? We started off with how to use mapping to teams according to a problem preference to the creativity. And right at the end, just a brilliant walkthrough as to how you develop that team. By the way, Joaquin, I saw lots in here that I'm really pleased about because I support a team. It's going through a little bit of a change. Started off with, as you describe, a wholesale cultural shift, then starting to use data to select players at the beginning of a journey, perhaps some rough diamonds that other people haven't worked out. But the sad thing for me is from what you're telling me, it may be seven or eight years until we actually see success. But the positive side being that the period of low success won't be as long the next time around, if I've interpreted that correctly. Yeah, that's right. Brilliant, thanks so much. Benjamin and Holger, first of all, just questions from you, I suppose, on what Hakim has spoken about. But actually, we're doing a round robin. So any comments, thoughts around each of your talks would be welcome. I cannot believe that we don't have a question in the chat. But that's brilliant, because I think we have loads amongst ourselves. I think, I think, what we see, we are not only focused on technology, we have all the balls and we have the technology, but we have also the team. We have to look how to put the right people on how they fit in this problem solving technique. And this is why it's not so easy to build up a product and a company, because you have to look all parallel at these situations. Yeah. I was just saying it shows you how applicable the mapping is to so many different lenses. Sorry, Benjamin. Yeah, well, something that occurred to me when Holger was speaking was the sales cycle and mapping out a sales cycle. Are you going to be speaking to a town planner or a pioneer, the town planner, they want, they want to know the details up front, and how this could break something important. The pioneer, you can tell them a story. And if you can get their heart into it, then half your battle is over. So I was thinking about if we were mapping out a sales strategy, who do we expect to encounter along the way on the sales cycle, and then tweak our messages to match the problem- problem solving style so that we're more likely to get their heads moving in the right direction. So just wanted to add that. Yeah, you lost when you tell a town planner a story about features. And then you lost when you go to a town planner and the town planner has to show his numbers next week. And when you have the idea how the people can work better together and have a good feeling. They say you're an idiot, I need to bring up my numbers next week. Give me some ideas how to make my numbers. But one tip for maybe I teach pioneer settler town planners and storytelling. I always think who is the decision maker when I have 10 arguments I go and started to go in the door of the decision maker. Maybe the decision maker is a town planner. I started my arguments in the town planner. When I have 10 arguments, I have five arguments for the town planner. But when I go to the settler and have two arguments for the settler, because it's very important that the town planner says, you have good ideas, but you have no heart. When you go to the settler, and then you go to the settler and then you go to the pioneer, maybe one argument. But if the decision maker, a settler, I started with my arguments with the settler. And then I go, I think of a triangle, when I go to the second decision maker and I train that. Yeah. When you don't have a resonant. Yeah, I'm smiling quietly because I do this job. And it's, you know, for us, it's IT, finance, ultimately the GTM, the strategy team. And it's similar personas, but really interesting point from Benjamin as well around mapping the variance of an individual, right? That might be down to, what did I put down? Down to different inputs. It might be seasonality, when in the year, when in the project, as Holger says. Really interesting. Yeah, actually, for sports people, right, you'll have variances in performance, variances in things like motivation that actually you can probably, you could probably map or at least get a sense of how that changes over time. Yeah, just following the example of Ben, well probably you have not realized, but one of the changes that the Golden State Warriors did in 2015, it was the change of coach. And it was a very, from that time, it was a very difficult decision because they were having Mark Jackson, that he was a type of problem solver on the right side. So he was able to put the team in playoffs, but he reached the peak. And that peak was not enough for the owners. And then they changed for a more pioneer coach, able to put the team at next level. And they knew that they need someone with a completely different mindset that breaks some of the traditions that the team was still not removing. And then they removed Mark Jackson and put Steve Kerr. And it worked. But it was also a decision based on the type of mindset that you are able to, that you need to resolve for that time. That's a fascinating example. And I am a terrible sports fan, so I'm not aware of any of this, but I'm interested now to follow, again, how leadership is managing the personalities of the problem solving styles, cognitive styles. Maybe more organizations are doing this than I'm aware, but it seems like something we can't ignore today. In fact, many of our organizations in the US have worked so hard on improving our diversity of background, of life experience, all of that. I don't think we can really tap that diversity until we start exploring the diversity of cognitive styles. So I'm glad to hear other organizations are doing that. Good question for you on that, which is which organizations are particularly good at doing this and mapping cognitive styles. But more importantly, how can we tell from the outside whether you're somebody looking to buy a company or to join one what are the what are the things you can look out for that will tell you that company does it well and it will actually be to find a blog post that specifically calls it out. That's that's an excellent question. I mean yeah I can I can give you the answer about how the MBA does it and it's that they do it about the measure of the performance, because they can do it. They measure the performance of the players' feet. So, they have a complete statistical history about the feet of three players together on the court and they can measure that over time. So they have rescued even information from the 90s and they have digitalized all that and made the players' feet to try to measure that feet, not the individual feet, but the team fit. And the Dallas Mavericks, from the Dallas Mavericks in 2011, they won the NBA champion. And they were not having individuals in the top 10 of anything, but they have the best team fit in the league. The best one. But they don't have any, just one brilliant person that was in the top ten, that it was Dirk Nowitzki, but the rest of the players, you, nobody remember a name, I can tell you. And it's an example, but it's a close environment, and you have data. You know, I'll add to that, Damien. I'm sorry, Holger, go ahead. I think when we look about cognitive styles, pioneer, settler, town planners, and maybe also symbolic styles, there's a great book from Bollman and Thiel, reframing leadership or organizations. The problem is what we need in the future or today, that the situational awareness change our style. That we are able to see, oh, better I go with a pioneer style now, or I go with a town planner. but we have different situational awareness and what we need is to understand in which situation we are, in which cognitive style is best for this problem. And this means you need to have on the meter level, that you can step out a little bit and say, who are we now and where do we have to go? And this is not so easy because we have also our preference style, but for leadership it's very important that you can change your styles. Right, right. And to go back to Damian's original question, how do you spot that in an organization or if you're considering joining an organization, I think the companies that are successful have figured it out. In today's market, you can't be successful, I don't think, without understanding how to manage these complex systems, especially around people and their cognitive styles. If I'm looking into an organization, and let's say it's a software space, I want to hear them talking about how they support structure autonomous teams. I want to be able to sense an atmosphere of trust. Things like task self-selection are not foreign concepts. And so while that's not a very good list to take into an interview, I think those are some of the things I would be looking for if I'm having a conversation with an organization I want to work with is how much trust is there, how autonomous are teams, and do they understand things like cognitive styles. the book that you mentioned, Ben, the Theme Topologies, they review really well how to integrate with different type of topologies. And in the review of the topologies, they review exactly that, how to combine different mindsets and ways to solve problems into the, because at the end of the day, you need to combine different type of thinkers to be able to solve problems and to resolve that integration. And sometimes you need to put a different person with a different style into a team that they all have the same to break some of the things. And this is the labor of the leadership to put that different piece to try to break things and make. Right. Right. And that book, Team Topologies, I recommend it to everyone. I'm not even the software guy. It's mostly for software teams. Really taught me a lot. Really good book. I was going to just mention that sometimes you can't match the task with the person's problem-solving style. And my example is this large automaker I work for. I'm way over here on the pioneer side. They are very process-focused, very system-focused. However, they do a very good job of providing me with processes and tools and support and mentorship when I have to work far from my preferred style, they have built the systems that can support me so I can be successful. So that's something I bring to other organizations or share with other organizations, build those processes that can support your team members when they have to work far from their preferred place on the map. are from their preferred place on the map. Awesome. We have time for one question. I'm going to ask it. We've got to give up the room. There is the final fireside chat in eight minutes. So we've run a little bit into overtime. I'm not going to stop working. Holger, lastly, I would love to hear about the change project and the outcome for the no-code solution. So, where you're doing your comparison now at the end of not just the sort of choice and implementation, but when you're actually looking at the business impact and compare that to the criteria you use in the selection. Did you end up with the same impacts that you hoped for in the winning selection? And I suppose the question is, will you come back to talk to us about it? Yeah, I will come. Next year, we will implement it. Thank you. Fantastic. Listen, thank you, everybody. Thank you, speakers. Thank you, everybody who has joined this session, but not just this session at MAPCAMP generally. As I say, we've got the fireside chat. It should be really interesting. I get to actually sit back and probably have a beer and just listen to it this time. But it's been a really great day, really great session here. I'll be following up with each of you personally. Actually, Benjamin, I'm expecting my results from you and my assessments somewhere soon. I think I've got a guess as to what it might say. I think you and I discussed, I'm probably quite clear on that. Joaquin, I need you to tell me what's going to happen with Arsenal. So if you can just do a little bit of research specific to us at the beginning of that journey. But it would be really good if you can sort of demystify and help me de-stress a little bit. But thanks a lot, I'm going to close the room. Do feel free to ask questions on Twitter, as Benjamin suggested. Let's keep this conversation going beyond today. If you've seen something inspiring today at MapCamp, follow up on it, because that's what really this is about. And certainly the Ignite talks are all about igniting passion, igniting purpose. Damian, thanks so much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you so much. Bye.
